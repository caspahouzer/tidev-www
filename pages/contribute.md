You can review the latest version of the CLA on our organization-docs Github repository here:

Here's our process for accepting a signed CLA:

1.  Contact Josh Lambert either via [Slack](https://slack.tidev.io) or via email ([josh@lambertmail.xyz](mailto:josh@lambertmail.xyz)) and request an e-sign link containing the CLA. Make sure you include the email address in your message that you want to receive the e-sign request!
2.  Complete the e-sign link when it arrives in your email from the TiDev Docusign account.
3.  Your name will appear on the list below within 5 business days, at which point, you'll be eligible to submit code and other IP to the TiDev project.
