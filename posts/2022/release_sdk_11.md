After months of hard work, we are proud to announce that today we can introduce Titanium SDK 11.0.0.RC.
The new version includes a massive amount of features and bug fixes.

You can see all the changes in the changelog [https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Release_Notes/](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Release_Notes/)

There is also a new version of the [Titanium CLI](https://github.com/tidev/titanium) (6.0.2) and [Alloy](https://github.com/tidev/alloy) (2.0.1).

**Follow these steps to get SDK 11.0.0.RC:**

2. **titanium sdk install 11.0.0.RC**

You can also execute **titanium sdk install latest** to get the latest **GA** of the Titanium SDK

We're also proud to announce the Alloy integration of [PurgeTSS](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_PurgeTSS.html), created by [macCesar](https://github.com/macCesar). [PurgeTSS](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_PurgeTSS.html) is an Alloy addon with predefined classes to use in the XML views. It can be used by all Titanium developers, who want to create beautiful designed mobile apps easily.
